  Welcome! Thanks for checking out our wedding site.

  This project is hosted at git@github.com:de1ux/nathanandlauren

  Fun facts about development
  1. no bootstrap.js, just a lot of google search copy/paste to make the layout resize on mobile. sorry IE users, didn't do much for you :(
  2. all images (except the Amazon logo in the registy) are royalty-free
  3. only two fonts are pulled in, the rest are browser defaults
  4. mailgun sends us notifications of new rsvps through a backend running on ec2
  5. the frontend is being served from an s3 bucket

      <p>
      Lauren and Siri moved from Western Washington to Montana in 2013 to pursue her Masters degree in Statistics. As a hoofed mammal enthusiast, she enjoys training a 3/4 yr old "Significantly Fancy" paint horse, Alex.

      Nathan moved from Arkansas to Montana in 2012 to pursue a career in software development. He likes programming easter eggs and riding his motorcycle.
      </p>
      <p>
      The couple originally met each other at a dog park in September of 2013. Shortly after they were inseparable. They enjoy going for long quad rides in the mountains and collecting pets.
      <br /><br />
      On December 26 of 2014 Nathan took Lauren on a walk and proposed with the dogs as witnesses. They are beyond excited to be tying the knot and hope you will celebrate with them!
